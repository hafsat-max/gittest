//A teacher got employed in a beautiful secondary school. The former teacher was sacked due to laziness. The schools has 13 prefects, 7 of which are girls. 3 of the girls are science students. 5 of the students are in ss3, 4 are in ss2. The teacher was employed during the holidays and given the student register from ss1 to ss3 to have a look at. In the register there is a field    that indicates whether a student is a prefect or not, another field that indicates whether a student is male or female, another for name and another for department.




//develop a function that adds all the ages of students.
//develop a function that returns the details of all prefects (including their sex and class and other things)
//develop a function that returns the number of boys that are prefects.
//develop a function that prints out the name of students in ss3 excluding the prefects in ss3
//develop a function that returns the total number of students.








//create an array of 4 students
//each array must be a json object
//the json object must have fields (age, name, favouriteMeals)
//the age is an integer, name is a string and favouriteMeals is an array of different types of foods

//using document.write, display the last student's favourite meals

//loop and display the name of the students
